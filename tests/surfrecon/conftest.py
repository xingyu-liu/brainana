"""Shared fixtures for surface-reconstruction tests.

Every mesh here is synthesised in numpy and written through
``nibabel.freesurfer.write_geometry``, so the whole suite runs in well under a
second and needs neither FreeSurfer binaries nor real subject data.

The three cube variants exist to cover a distinction the pipeline used to miss:
Euler characteristic alone does not characterise a good surface. ``badwind_cube``
is closed with Euler 2 and still broken.
