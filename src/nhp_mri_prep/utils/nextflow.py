    Create symlink from source to target, fallback to copy if symlink fails.

    This function is used in Nextflow processes to avoid duplicating large files
    between the work directory and process output directory. Nextflow's publishDir
    will follow the symlink and copy the actual file content to the final output.

    IMPORTANT: Resolves source symlinks to the original non-symlink file before
    creating a new symlink. This prevents deep symlink chains.

    Symlinks can fail with "Operation not supported" (errno 95 / EOPNOTSUPP) when
    the target directory is on a filesystem that does not support them, such as:
    - Docker bind-mounts from a Windows host
    - NFS or network shares mounted with nosymlink
    - FAT32, exFAT, or other non-Unix filesystems

    In those cases the function falls back to copying the file.
