Setup and configuration
------------------------

.. rst-class:: faq-question

Do I need a config file?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. Built-in defaults are used for all pipeline steps. To customise the pipeline you have two options:

1. **Config file (recommended):** Generate a YAML config file with the :ref:`generating-config-file` interactive generator (in :doc:`usage_notes`), mount it into the container (e.g. ``-v <path/to/config.yaml>:/config.yaml``), and pass ``--config /config.yaml``.
2. **Command-line arguments:** Pass common options directly in the ``docker run`` command (e.g. ``--anat_only``, ``--output_space "NMT2Sym:res-1"``). See :ref:`command-line-arguments`.

.. rst-class:: faq-question

Can I run without a FreeSurfer license?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anatomical and functional preprocessing will still run, but surface reconstruction will be skipped. The container will warn if the license is missing.

Get a free license at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html, then mount it with ``-v <path/to/license.txt>:/fs_license.txt`` and pass ``--freesurfer-license /fs_license.txt``.

.. rst-class:: faq-question

What if I don't have a compatible GPU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run the pipeline without a GPU; it will use the CPU. Omit ``--gpus`` from your ``docker run`` command—no other options are needed.

If you do have an NVIDIA GPU and want to use it, add ``--gpus all`` and ensure the `NVIDIA Container Toolkit <https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html>`_ is installed on the host. See :doc:`installation` for setup steps.

Running on your system
----------------------

.. rst-class:: faq-question

Can I use a network drive for input or output?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**We recommend keeping the output directory and work directory on local storage.** Writing to a network drive (NFS, SMB, etc.) can cause permission errors, copy failures in early stages, or poor I/O performance and timeouts. If you see failures that look like permission or copy issues soon after the run starts, try pointing the output and work-directory mounts to local paths.

**Input on a network drive is fine.** You can leave your BIDS dataset on a network share and set the output (and work directory) to a local path. For example: mount the network BIDS root with ``-v <path/on/network/bids_dir>:/input`` and use local paths for ``-v <path/on/local/output_dir>:/output`` and ``-v <path/on/local/work_dir>:/output_wd``. The pipeline reads from the network and writes only to local disk.

.. _docker-run-as-user-not-root:

.. rst-class:: faq-question

I don't want Brainana to run as root. I want it to run as my own user. What should I do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before ``docker run``, ensure the **output** directory on your host already exists and is owned by your user. If you pass ``--work-dir`` (with a matching ``-v`` mount for the work directory), do the same for that host path. Mount those directories into the container with ``-v``.

That way Docker does not create those directories as root inside the container. 

Whenever practical, create fresh output and work directories (owned by you) instead of reusing old paths—this also avoids permission problems carried over from earlier runs.

.. _windows-paths:

.. rst-class:: faq-question

I'm on Windows — how do I write paths?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Docker volume mounts (``-v``) require the **host** path (the part before ``:``) to use
**forward slashes**, regardless of which Windows terminal you use.
The paths **inside** the container (after ``:``) are always Linux paths and never change.

**PowerShell or Command Prompt**

Replace backslashes with forward slashes in the host path:

.. code-block:: text

   # Replace this:
   #   -v C:\Users\me\bids:/input
   # With this:
   #   -v C:/Users/me/bids:/input

Full example:

.. code-block:: powershell

   docker run -it --rm `
       -v C:/Users/me/bids:/input `
       -v C:/Users/me/output:/output `
       -v C:/Users/me/work:/output_wd `
       liuxingyu987/brainana:<version> /input /output `
       --work-dir /output_wd

.. note::

   In PowerShell, use the backtick for line continuation instead of the backslash (``\``).

**WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**

Use the ``/mnt/c/`` prefix to reference Windows drives:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -it --rm \
       -v /mnt/c/Users/me/bids:/input \
       -v /mnt/c/Users/me/output:/output \
       -v /mnt/c/Users/me/work:/output_wd \
       liuxingyu987/brainana:<version> /input /output \
       --work-dir /output_wd

Resources and troubleshooting
-----------------------------

.. rst-class:: faq-question

How do I align container resources with Nextflow?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The container defaults to 8 CPUs and 20 GB for Nextflow (controlled by ``NXF_MAX_CPUS`` and ``NXF_MAX_MEMORY``). To change these:

- Pass ``-e NXF_MAX_CPUS=<n>`` and ``-e NXF_MAX_MEMORY=<n>g`` to ``docker run``.
- Use ``-profile minimal`` (4 CPUs, 16 GB) or ``-profile recommended`` (8+ CPUs, 32 GB) for preset profiles.

See :ref:`command-line-arguments` for the full resource options.

.. rst-class:: faq-question

My pipeline run is hanging.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This typically happens when Nextflow runs out of memory. Try one or more of the following:

- Increase the RAM available to Docker.
- Use ``-profile minimal`` to reduce resource usage.
- Set ``-e NXF_MAX_CPUS`` and ``-e NXF_MAX_MEMORY`` to match your available resources.
- Resume from the last checkpoint by re-running the same command (Nextflow resume is enabled by default, provided the work directory is mounted — see :ref:`usage-docker-guide`).

.. rst-class:: faq-question

The pipeline fails with an out-of-memory error when I run it in Docker. What should I do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**On Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux with Docker Desktop):**

Docker Desktop runs containers inside a Linux virtual machine that has a configurable **Memory** limit. 
By default, this limit is **50% of your host RAM** (see `Docker Desktop advanced settings <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings-and-maintenance/settings/#advanced>`_).
If this default (for example, 4 GB on an 8 GB machine) is too low, the pipeline can run out of memory even though the host itself still has free RAM.

To fix this, open Docker Desktop and go to ``Settings → Resources → Advanced``. Increase the **Memory** allocation (for example, to 6–7 GB on an 8 GB machine), apply the changes, and rerun the pipeline.

**On native Docker on Linux (no Docker Desktop):**

There is no Docker Desktop VM, so there is no extra global memory cap. Out-of-memory errors here usually mean either:
the container truly exceeds available system RAM, or you (or your system) have set explicit memory limits (for example, ``--memory 4g`` or cgroup limits).

In that case, you may need to run on a machine with more RAM and/or relax or remove those explicit Docker/cgroup memory limits.
