"""Version consistency guards for brainana.

Ensures ``get_version()`` reflects ``pyproject.toml``, that installed dist-info
metadata stays aligned after editable installs, and that the Brainana Lite
notebook does not ship pinned to a stale release tag.

See ``docs_temp/update_instruction/version_guideline.md`` for the full list of
files a release touches; ``scripts/bump_version.py`` applies them all at once.
